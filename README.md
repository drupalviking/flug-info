# flug-info
Drupal module to handle the consumption and display of domestic and international flights in Iceland

## History
ruv.is wanted to display information regarding departure and arrival times of aircrafts, both domestic and international.
The problem was, that there is no one point of access for this information.  Actually, there are two:  apis.is and xml service 
from Air Iceland, which handles two airlines, itself and Nordair.  The third airline does not have any service, but that's in
the making.
